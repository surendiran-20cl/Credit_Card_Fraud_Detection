# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Implemented Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest on an imbalanced dataset. Used StandardScaler for normalization, stratified train-test split, and evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Random Forest outperformed with higher recall &amp; F1-score. Future scope: SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning, deep learning.
